**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in our domain is hosting data on IPFS using blockchain.
**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
The potential investigation for quarter 2 is to build a decentralized data marketplace on the ETH blockchain where files are hosted on IPFS
**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
I would like to prioritize more frequent collaboration as sometimes there are issues that come up that completely negate progress done by one person due to miscommunication.
**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project**
I would like to incorporate collaborative filtering given time to match users with suitable datasets.
